Note: The number of individual samples from each population was limited by funding and the number of king rails captured. King rails are difficult to capture [due to their secretive nature](https://www.pgc.pa.gov/Wildlife/EndangeredandThreatened/Pages/KingRail.aspx), and so we are very fortuneate to have received samples from our collaborators (listed below).
