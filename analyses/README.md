Note: Sample numbers were constrained by funding and the number of king rails captured. King rails are difficult to capture [due to their secretive nature](https://www.pgc.pa.gov/Wildlife/EndangeredandThreatened/Pages/KingRail.aspx), and so we are very fortunate to have received the samples we did from our collaborators (listed below).
