## SNP filtering & variant calling
> I will be using [ANGSD (Analysis of next generation Sequencing Data)] (http://www.popgen.dk/angsd/index.php/ANGSD) to do a comparative analysis of four geographically distinct populations of king rails. This will involve variant calling, genetic differentiation (FST) analysis, and estimating nucleotide diversity (Ï€).

[*Range map created by the Audubon Society*](https://www.audubon.org/field-guide/bird/king-rail)     
Note: The number of individual samples from each population was limited by funding and the number of king rails captured. King rails are difficult to capture [due to their secretive nature](https://www.pgc.pa.gov/Wildlife/EndangeredandThreatened/Pages/KingRail.aspx), and so we are very fortuneate to have received samples from our collaborators (listed below).
