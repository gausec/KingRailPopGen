### Tips

1. Helpful commands (**BASH**)
   - `df -h /home` : check disk space (human readable output)
   - `du -hs` : check current directory space usage
   - `htop` : process-viewer and process-manager
   - `free -g -h -t` : check memory (human readable)
   - `wc -l` : count the number of lines
   - `ls -1 | wc -l` : count files in current directory
  
2. Helpful commands (**R**)
   - `list.files(path = ".")` : check what files are in your current working directory (the one linked to the project)
   - `help()` : sometimes there is documentation for an R command that you can check
   - `example()` : see examples of how to use a command
   - `read.csv()` and `read.table()`
   - `class()` and `print(typeof())` : check the data type
   - Did you know in R studio, you can highlight text to add quotes just by using shift + `"` to save time?
