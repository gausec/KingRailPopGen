## King Rail Population Comparison

#### This repository contains files and information pertaining to whole genome data of four species (king rail, clapper rail, Virginia rail, and eastern bluebird). My research centers the king rail, and so the primary focus of this repository is the processing and analyzing of king rail whole genome data.

### Aim
I am interested in comparing four geographically separate king rail populations to assess genetic diversity and gene flow. Time permitting, I am also interested in finding genes or genomic regions that affect migration traits (*e.g.*, migratory timing and direction).

### Natural history & background
The  king rail is a very secretive, freshwater marsh bird. While it is chicken-sized, it is very hard to see due to the dense emergent vegetation it inhabits. As you might imagine, this makes these rails very difficult to study. For this reason, we don't know as much about king rails as we do about easier-to-study species. It is really important to study these birds as they are indicators of freshwater marsh ecosystem health. They are sensitive to environmental changes, and their [populations have been declining for over half a century](https://abcbirds.org/bird/king-rail/). The king rail is listed as [federally endangered in Canada](https://naturecanada.ca/discover-nature/endangered-species/king-rail/) and as [threatened or endangered by 12 states in the United States](https://birdsoftheworld.org/bow/species/kinrai4/cur/introduction#:~:text=Despite%20this%20broad%20geographic%20range,as%20well%20as%20in%20Canada.).  
 
The distribution of the king rail has become concentrated along the east coast. This is a result of inland freshwater marshes vanishing [due to land-use changes and habitat degradation](https://portal.ct.gov/DEEP/Wildlife/Fact-Sheets/King-Rail). This phenomenon has further led to the southeastern coast becoming the preferred habitat for these birds. However, populations along the east coast face their own challenges: climate change has led to sea-level rise and increased occurrences of intense storms resulting in saltwater intrusion. This change in habitat conditions [renders these areas unsuitable for the king rail](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/King_Rail/lifehistory#). The clapper rail, which is tolerant of saltwater, [often out-competes the king rail in brackish habitats](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6202719/). Additionally, the presence of the invasive plant Phragmites in both inland and coastal marshes further complicates the situation. King rails can tolerate this plant but have not been observed nesting in it.  

**For these reasons, it is becoming increasingly urgent to learn more about this species.**
