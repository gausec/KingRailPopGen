## King Rail Population Comparison

#### This repository contains files and information pertaining to whole genome data of four species (king rail, clapper rail, Virginia rail, and eastern bluebird). My research centers the king rail, and so the primary focus of this repository is the processing and analyzing of king rail whole genome data.

### Aim
I am interested in comparing four geographically separate king rail populations to assess genetic diversity and gene flow. Time permitting, I am also interested in finding genes or genomic regions that affect migration traits (*e.g.*, migratory timing and direction).
